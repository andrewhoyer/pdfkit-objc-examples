# pdfkit-basics

## Overview

This is a single-view XCode project for displaying simple PDFKit implementations.

## How To Use

Open the project in XCode and open the **ViewController.m** file, then locate the **viewDidLoad** function. Initially only one function is called:

```
[self displaySimplestLayout];
```

To run any particular example, comment out all function commands besides the one you want to display.
